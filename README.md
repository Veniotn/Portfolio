# Readme


Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio. This repo contains all the assignment programs that I've made during my time at NSCC.

I placed each folder in chonological order from my first programming course forward. Before joining NSCC I never thought I would be able to learn how to code, however I hope this document shows my progression from not knowing what an int is to now.

I hope to take this foundation forward into my career and am excited to learn and improve everyday in whatever position I'm put into.

Finally, I also attached my resume to the bottom of the repo if interested!

# Folders

  1 - Highlights:
      This contains my favorite projects over the past 2 years.
      
  2 - Intro to Programming (Java):
      Learned the basics of logic and primitive data types, delved into method making but never left the main class.
      
  3 - Intro to OOP (Java):
      Learned the basics of Object Oriented Programming (Classes, Constructors, Inheritance)
      and expanded on Java knowledge and practice.

  4 - C Based Programming:
      First look into C, learned about header files, memory management and bit shifting.

  5 - C#:
      Learned advanced OOP concepts like delegates and event sending, also delved into .net programming.

  6 - C++:
      Learned more about memory management, made multiple programs using OOP and file I/O.

  7 - Android Development (Java): 
      Created multiple android applications, created guis used OOP in java and implemented DB connections.

  8 - Data Structures (C++):
      Learned about popular searching algorithms (Linked lists, Queues, Stacks, Recursion, Binary Search Trees) and 
      popular sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, bubble sort).

  9 - Capstone (Python):
      An arcade boxing machine program that uses a raspberry pi and hx711 load cells to output the force of a users punch.
